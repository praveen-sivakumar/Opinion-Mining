   Main Idea is to get feedback from students and classify them as positive and negative feedback and present it to the professors so that they can improve their delivery of lectures in future
  
   We used pre-trained BERT base language model developed by google which is already trained with 2500 Million words

    Processes carried out are Tokenize,Indexing,Traning and Evaluating the model
