# 6 - Transformers for Sentiment Analysis

In this notebook we will be using the transformer model, first introduced in [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) paper. Specifically, we will be using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model from [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) paper. 

Transformer models are considerably larger than anything else covered in these tutorials. As such we are going to use the [transformers library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) to get pre-trained transformers and use them as our embedding layers. We will freeze (not train) the transformer and only train the remainder of the model which learns from the representations produced by the transformer. In this case we will be using a multi-layer bi-directional GRU, however any model can learn from these representations.

## Preparing Data

First, as always, let's set the random seeds for deterministic results.

"""The transformer has already been trained with a specific vocabulary, which means we need to train with the exact same vocabulary and also tokenize our data in the same way that the transformer did when it was initially trained.

Luckily, the transformers library has tokenizers for each of the transformer models provided. In this case we are using the BERT model which ignores casing (i.e. will lower case every word). We get this by loading the pre-trained `bert-base-uncased` tokenizer.
"""

**Note**: the tokenizer does have a beginning of sequence and end of sequence attributes (`bos_token` and `eos_token`) but these are not set and should not be used for this transformer.

This is because we need to append two tokens to each sequence, one to the start and one to the end."""

As we already have the vocabulary for our text, provided by the transformer we set `use_vocab = False` to tell torchtext that we'll be handling the vocabulary side of things. We pass our `tokenize_and_cut` function as the tokenizer. The `preprocessing` argument is a function that takes in the example after it has been tokenized, this is where we will convert the tokens to their indexes. Finally, we define the special tokens - making note that we are defining them to be their index value and not their string value, i.e. `100` instead of `[UNK]` This is because the sequences will already be converted into indexes.

We define the label field as before.

Instead of using an embedding layer to get embeddings for our text, we'll be using the pre-trained transformer model. These embeddings will then be fed into a GRU to produce a prediction for the sentiment of the input sentence. We get the embedding dimension size (called the `hidden_size`) from the transformer via its config attribute. The rest of the initialization is standard.

Within the forward pass, we wrap the transformer in a `no_grad` to ensure no gradients are calculated over this part of the model. The transformer actually returns the embeddings for the whole sequence as well as a *pooled* output. The [documentation](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/bert.html#transformers.BertModel) states that the pooled output is "usually not a good summary of the semantic content of the input, youâ€™re often better with averaging or pooling the sequence of hidden-states for the whole input sequence", hence we will not be using it. The rest of the forward pass is the standard implementation of a recurrent model, where we take the hidden state over the final time-step, and pass it through a linear layer to get our predictions.
